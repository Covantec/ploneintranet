---------------------

* Merge pull request #1004 from quaive/make-news-filter-optional [GitHub]
* Make filtering by published state optional in the news portlet. This leaves it to the integrator to do a gradual transition to the news app [Alexander Pilz]
* Merge pull request #1002 from quaive/cart-propagate-groupname [GitHub]
* Propagate the groupname parameter in cart actions that inject the sidebar. This makes sure we stay at the same navigation level when grouping is not by folder. [Manuel Reinhardt]
* Merge pull request #1001 from quaive/portlet_contacts_recent [GitHub]
* Added registry record to toggle display of recent contacts in the contacts portlet. refs https://github.com/quaive/ploneintranet.prototype/pull/416 [Manuel Reinhardt]

* Merge pull request #992 from quaive/release-1.2.x [GitHub]
* @ale-rt I had to remove these two lines on production again. If there is no read_uids, it only means a user has never read a news item. Then no news portlet is shown. He will never be able to read anything... [Alexander Pilz]
* Back to development: 1.2.0a32 [Alexander Pilz]

* Merge pull request #983 from quaive/use-groupid [GitHub]

* Use groupid when principal is a group [Alessandro Pisa]
* Merge pull request #982 from quaive/release-1.2.x [GitHub]

* The delete conformation modal needs to be large, since the buttons contain lots of text, and in translations such as DE it can become even longer. [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Add status message about deletion to be in line with the rest of our content [Wolfgang Thomas]
* A button that submits a form in a modal must never have `close-panel`, since that just closes the modal... [Wolfgang Thomas]
* For whatever reason we were using namechooser and idnormalizer. I think to remember that I did this back then to be extra safe.  namechooser alone is the canonical plone behavior. So that changes back to it now. [Alexander Pilz]

* added some German translations [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Merge pull request #938 from quaive/selfhealing [GitHub]
* With all the refactoring and performance improvements that came with the paradigm "we only support membrane" groups and the introduction of workgroups, a lot of assumptions were hard-coded that break the existing "workspaces can be membrane groups" behaviour. This behaviour was built to be fully PAS compatible and therefore provides all the required methods and properties. The current performance enhancements for the workspace sidebar assume that we are always dealing with membrane objects, and not GroupData via PAS. This commit attempts to leave all the performance enhancements in place, while restoring the basic functionality of using PAS in case of the MembraneWorkspaceGroup behaviour. [Wolfgang Thomas]

* proof of concept for cut, copy and paste. for the 2 actions that require a modal, there are 2 scenarios: - delete: attemps to open the modal. You can even briefly see it. Then a white overlay overs   everything. Probably because this modal is injected in #items in the sidebar - mail: the complete form is injected into #items in the sidebar. Works fine, but probably   not something that cornelis will approve of. Also, the "Cancel" case would need to be handled   separately, since we cannot simple close the modal In both cases (delete and mail), there is a hard reload of the page after a successful action [Wolfgang Thomas]

A disabled checkbox, even if checked, is not present in the request. This messes up the handler for the checkboxes in the sidebar. Therefore, we need to track via "hidden" input fields which tasks are really checked and also which tasks have just been unchecked. [Wolfgang Thomas]

* The index_html portal_tabs action comprises the default value when determining which tab is active. If an arbitrary browser view is called on the portal root which is not present in the portal_tabs, the index_html action will be highlighted in the tab navi as current. This is not true however, one example is the notifications view. If viewed, it highlights the dashboard.

* Add a test for the scenario: User X is member of workspace A, WS A is member of WS B, WS B is member of WS C Then User X is member of workspace C [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Moved activating the IMembraneGroup behavior to setUpPloneSite of the testing layer [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Add an event handler that checks if the FTI for workspaces was modied & the IMembraneUserGroups behavior added or removed. In this case update the membrane tool and reindex all workspaces [Wolfgang Thomas]
* We also need to make sure our IMembraneGroup behavior provides IMembraneUserGroups, so that the membrane_groups plugin can found out, which workspaces a workspace is a member of. Example: Workspace B has as member Workspace A Workspace A can only know (in the membrane sense) that it is a member of workspace B via the IMembraneUserGroups lookup [Wolfgang Thomas]
* use membrane users, not basic PloneUsers, so that the permissions based on membership in a membrane group will be properly assigned [Wolfgang Thomas]
* we need to make sure the Products.membrane profile is applied to the site in test setup [Wolfgang Thomas]
* make sure the membrane_groups plugin comes before recursive_groups [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Creating a behaviour for IGroup provides the lookup workspace->members. But still missing (in the security sense) is the lookup user->workspaces, which is required for checking access permissions of an individual user. If access is granted to a user indirectly via membership in a workspace-group, this missing lookup would lead to Unauthorized. Therefore, we need to adapt the membrane user object (for dexterity) so that it also implements IMembraneUserGroups and thereby fulfils the contract of IGroupsPlugin from Products.PluggableAuthService [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Add a failing test that checks if permisison via group membership in a groupspace gets properly propagated [Wolfgang Thomas]

1.1.0a0 (2016-04-06)
--------------------

* Prepare intermediate private release 1.1.0a0
* Merge remote-tracking branch 'quaive/master' [Guido A.J. Stevens]
* Merge branch 'release-1.0.x' [Guido A.J. Stevens]
* Merge pull request #35 from quaive/34-fix-unindexing-problem [Guido Stevens]
* overwrite default indexer for getObjPositionInParent, so that we can add a try-except block. Reason: during unindexing (in the solr code), fetching the position of an obj that is in the process of being deleted will fail, see #34 [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Merge pull request #31 from quaive/add-csrf-token-to-paste [Guido Stevens]
* Due to the recent change how the bulk actions work, the csrf token was not passed anymore and thus the paste failed. This readds the token [Alexander Pilz]
* Merge pull request #30 from quaive/translation-support [Guido Stevens]
* fix changed order [Alexander Pilz]
* translation fixes [Alexander Pilz]
* Merge pull request #28 from quaive/library-fix-order [Guido Stevens]
* Merge branch 'master' into library-fix-order In the conflicted src/ploneintranet/docconv/client/handlers.py I picked the version from master, since its effect is equivalent to my solution [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Merge pull request #26 from quaive/ikath-docconv [Guido Stevens]
* bump version [Guido A.J. Stevens]
* When the library content is displayed, the order of the items must be kept [Wolfgang Thomas]
* If items get re-arranged inside the library, make sure the object position in parent gets reindexed [Wolfgang Thomas]
* We also need to index getObjPositionInParent in solr [Wolfgang Thomas]
* In the current version of plone.app.content (3.0.20) there's a bug in the code that creates an `ordering` object: the acquisition context gets removed. This means 1) in our event handler content_edited_in_workspace (docconv), the obj does not have a REQUEST object, but only a string 2) other event handlers that act on IContainerModifiedEvent (sent out after content gets rearranged) cannot perform any operations that require acquisition context I have submitted a PR for this bug: https://github.com/plone/plone.app.content/pull/81 Until it gets merged, with a new release of p.a.content, we need this monkey patch. Therefore, I place all patch-related changes into this single commit, so that we can easily revert it later. [Wolfgang Thomas]

* move code that uses path_depth into block dealing with path [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Fix library view: for computing the current sections and their children, only look one level deep, instead of listing all contents ad infinitum [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Fix computation of path_depth. We DO NOT want to count the length of the path string, we want to count the number of path elements (including the root). Example: /Plone/library has a depth of 3 [Wolfgang Thomas]
* deactivate test until we figure out how to run the tests with ASYNC_ENABLED==True [Alexander Pilz]

* Prepare to be able to make docconv asynchronously [Alexander Pilz]

* Schedule longest-running partial job first for fastest total-job completion in case of runner contention. [Guido A.J. Stevens]
